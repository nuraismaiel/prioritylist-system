# PriorityList-System

This Java project implements a generic, sorted priority list using a fixed-size array. It supports efficient insertion and removal while maintaining sorted order, with optional support for custom comparators.

## Features

- Add and remove elements while keeping list sorted
- Binary search for fast insertion and lookup
- Merge two naturally ordered priority lists
- Recursive and non-recursive sorting algorithms
- Bidirectional linear search with logging

## Technologies Used

- Java 17
- Eclipse IDE (compatible with any Java IDE)
- No external libraries â€” pure Java implementation
